# Privacy Policy for ZeroAd

**Effective Date: February 3, 2026**

ZeroAd ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the ZeroAd mobile application.

## 1. Zero Data Collection
ZeroAd is designed with privacy as its core principle. 
* **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact list.
* **No Browsing History:** We do not log or monitor your DNS queries or browsing history. All DNS filtering is processed locally on your device.
* **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics tools to track your behavior within the app.

## 2. Android VpnService
ZeroAd uses the Android `VpnService` to provide its DNS filtering functionality.
* **Purpose:** The `VpnService` is used to create a local VPN tunnel that intercepts DNS traffic to block known adware and tracking domains.
* **Data Handling:** All traffic intercepted by the `VpnService` is processed **locally on your device**. No data is sent to a remote server for filtering or analysis.
* **User Control:** You can start and stop the Network Shield (VPN) at any time through the application interface.

## 3. Deep Scan Engine
The Deep Scan feature analyzes the metadata (permissions, package names, and manifest flags) of installed applications on your device.
* **Local Analysis:** All scanning logic and risk assessments are performed entirely on your device.
* **No Uploads:** The list of installed apps or the results of the scan are never uploaded to our servers.

## 4. Third-Party Services
ZeroAd does not integrate with any third-party services that could collect your data. There are no ads within the application.

## 5. Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to ensure that the local processing of your data remains secure within the Android sandbox environment.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
